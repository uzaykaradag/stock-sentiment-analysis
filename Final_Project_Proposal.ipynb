    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the **[tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/)** module to gather tweets using the Twitter API for the given stock using queries containing the respective ticker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "After gathering tweets about our respective stocks we will perform sentiment anlaysis on the tweets about the given ticker using various NLP modules. We will then use this sentiments to predict if the stock will close higher or lower than the opening price on that date. We will test the data using the price time series from the **yfinance** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will start off by acquiring the raw tweets from the **tweepy** module and then process the raw text data using the several methods we learned during the class. We will then form a DataFrame using the **pandas** library where individual tickers and dates are listed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will do Exploratory Data Analysis to get a better picture on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use **spaCy** and **NLTK** to perform sentiment analysis in the newly formed DataFrame. We may fine tune features and other parameters given the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will test the model against historical price data gathered from **yfinance**. May circle back to Step 2 if needed.\n",

    "## Atabey's notes\n",
    "\n",
    "I like the fact that you have a clear idea which tools you are going to use to collect the data. However, this is still a very weak proposal. Something written in less than an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must show a sample of the data and explain each of the pieces. You must explain how you are going to clean the twitter data, also how you are going to match the timelines. The data you are going to collect from Yahoo is a time series, the same goes for the twitter data. You must also explain how you are going to convert text data (twitter data) into usable numerical time series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the models: how you are going to check any correlations, cause/effect relationships between twitter data and yfinance data? What are your questions? What is your hypothesis? How are you going to test it? What ML algorithms are available? Which ones do you think are appropriate to use? I need more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the labor division and time-table is not detailed enough."
